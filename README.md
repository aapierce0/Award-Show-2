# Award-Show-2

This is a fun game that you can play alongside televised awards shows (such as the Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, etc), where your friends and family can bet on who will win each category. This app runs as a web server, and users can connect to it over a local network.

You will need:
* A smartphone (Android, iOS, or even Windows Phone), tablet, or laptop for each player.
* An extra device (preferably tablet or laptop) to serve as the game "host"
* A computer to act as the webserver (this can be the same as the game "host" if you prefer)
